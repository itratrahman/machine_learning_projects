# Description

As I scurried across the candlelit chamber, manuscripts in hand, I thought I'd made it. Nothing would be able to hurt me anymore. Little did I know there was one last fright lurking around the corner.

DING! My phone pinged me with a disturbing notification. It was Will, the scariest of Kaggle moderators, sharing news of another data leak.

"ph’nglui mglw’nafh Cthulhu R’lyeh wgah’nagl fhtagn!" I cried as I clumsily dropped my crate of unbound, spooky books. Pages scattered across the chamber floor. How will I ever figure out how to put them back together according to the authors who wrote them? Or are they lost, forevermore? Wait, I thought... I know, machine learning!

In this year's Halloween playground competition, you're challenged to predict the author of excerpts from horror stories by Edgar Allan Poe, Mary Shelley, and HP Lovecraft. We're encouraging you (with cash prizes!) to share your insights in the competition's discussion forum and code in Kernels. We've designated prizes to reward authors of kernels and discussion threads that are particularly valuable to the community. Click the "Prizes" tab on this overview page to learn more.
