# Description
It can be hard to know how much something’s really worth. Small details can mean big differences in pricing. For example, one of these sweaters cost $335 and the other cost $9.99. Can you guess which one’s which?

Product pricing gets even harder at scale, considering just how many products are sold online. Clothing has strong seasonal pricing trends and is heavily influenced by brand names, while electronics have fluctuating prices based on product specs.

Mercari, Japan’s biggest community-powered shopping app, knows this problem deeply. They’d like to offer pricing suggestions to sellers, but this is tough because their sellers are enabled to put just about anything, or any bundle of things, on Mercari's marketplace.

In this competition, Mercari’s challenging you to build an algorithm that automatically suggests the right product prices. You’ll be provided user-inputted text descriptions of their products, including details like product category name, brand name, and item condition.

Note that, because of the public nature of this data, this competition is a “Kernels Only” competition. In the second stage of the challenge, files will only be available through Kernels and you will not be able to modify your approach in response to new data.
