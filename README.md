# Machine Learning Projects

## Repository Description
This repository contains my machine learning projects on mostly kaggle data. Note that predictive or classification models I use here are not the actual models that I use to create the submissions, but very similar to that. The jupyter notebooks here serve as excellent tutorials. I have embarked on a career as video course publisher. So these notebooks might end up as lesson materials.

## Installation of Drivers & Software
Most models are trained using `gpu enabled virtual machines` on Google Cloud with the latest versions of [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) and `cuda drivers`installed. So do not try to run them without gpu-enabled workstations or linux kernels. I am currently using deep learning virtual machines which can be launched using a single command on Google Cloud ([More Information](https://cloud.google.com/deep-learning-vm/docs/tensorflow_start_instance)). Some models are also trained on [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb).
