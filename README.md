# Machine Learning Repository

This repository contains my machine learning projects on kaggle data. Note that predictive or classification models I use here are not the actualy model that I use to create the submission. The jupyter notebooks here serve as excellent tutorials. I have embarked on a career as video course publisher. So these notebooks might end up as lesson materials.
