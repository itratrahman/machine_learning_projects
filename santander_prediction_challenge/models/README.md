# File and folder description
- `dnn_regressor.ipynb` - notebook which preprocess feature engineers data, has functions which creates dnn regressor model based on given parameters and hyperparameters, and trains mutiple dnn models based on caviar search strategy.
- `model_cost_figures` - a directory which contains the png plots of cost vs iterations of the different dnn models trained using `dnn_regressor.ipynb`.
- `model_files` - a directory which contains tensorflow model files of the different dnn models trained using `dnn_regressor.ipynb`.
- `submission_files` - a directory which contains the csv submission files of the different dnn models trained using `dnn_regressor.ipynb`.
