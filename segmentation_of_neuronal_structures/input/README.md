## Training data
The training data is a set of 30 sections from a serial section Transmission Electron Microscopy (ssTEM) data set of the Drosophila first instar larva ventral nerve cord (VNC). The microcube measures 2 x 2 x 1.5 microns approx., with a resolution of 4x4x50 nm/pixel.

The corresponding binary labels are provided in an in-out fashion, i.e. white for the pixels of segmented objects and black for the rest of pixels (which correspond mostly to membranes).

This is the only data that participants are allowed to use to train their algorithms.

## Test Data
The contesting segmentation methods will be ranked by their performance on a test dataset, also available under "downloads", after registration. This test data is another volume from the same Drosophila first instar larva VNC as the training dataset.
